## About Me

Hello! I'm Nikhil Reddy Nookala, a passionate Computer Science MS student. My journey in the tech world is driven by a thirst for knowledge and a love for creating innovative solutions. Here, you'll find a showcase of my projects, contributions, and learning experiences as I build and refine my skills.

## What You'll Find Here

### Projects üöÄ
- **Car Price Prediction**: ‚Å†It‚Äôs a bot that predicts the current Prices of reselling cars. So that the sellers and buyers have an Idea of the purchase that will be made, we proposed a model to estimate the cost of the used cars using the K nearest neighbour algorithm, which is simple and suitable for small data sets.
- **Diabetes prediction using machine learning**:  ‚Å†The aim of this analysis is to develop a system that might predict the diabetic risk level of a patient with better accuracy. Model development is based on categorization methods such as Decision Trees, ANN, Naive Bayes, and SVM algorithms. For Decision trees, the models give precisions of 85%, 77% for Naive Bayes, and 77.3% for Support Vector machines. Outcomes show significant accuracy of the methods.
- **Online Price Comparison Website Python**: ‚Å†To obtain the best deals from Price comparison websites, web crawlers and web scraping techniques are used to fetch detailed information. This way, the paper aims to provide a solution for online customers to buy products at a good price and save valuable time, effort, and money.
- **Face Mask Detection**: his project on face mask detection detects if a person is wearing a mask primarily in public places or not. In a pandemic time like this, this project can become one of many solutions to maintaining safety among people.
- **Game of Hangman**: ‚Å†It is a game where a user is asked to guess the word by its letters. If he/she fails to guess, the game starts to make the man hang one by one. It is a fun game to play with friends. Used Object Oriented concepts to build the game in Java.
- **Movie Recommender System**: ‚Å†A system that suggests movies based on user requests and general traffic uses concepts of collaborative filtering and clustering in making decisions.
